Project Name: SpringGuard: Robust User Management with JWT Security

Description:

SpringGuard is a comprehensive Spring Boot application designed to provide secure user registration, login, and API protection using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication. 
This project leverages Spring Security to ensure robust security measures for user data and API endpoints. 
With SpringGuard, developers can implement a secure authentication mechanism, manage user roles, and safeguard APIs against unauthorized access.

Features:

User Registration: Secure user registration with password encoding.
User Login: Authentication and generation of JWT tokens for session management.
Role Management: Assign and manage user roles for role-based access control.
JWT Authentication: Secure API endpoints with JWT tokens to ensure only authorized access.
Password Encryption: Utilize bcrypt for strong password encryption.
Database Integration: Persist user data and roles in a MySQL database.
Spring Boot Framework: Built with Spring Boot 2.5.1 for rapid development and easy deployment.

Technologies Used:

Spring Boot
Spring Security
JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
Hibernate
MySQL
Maven

Getting Started:

Clone the repository.
Configure the MySQL database settings in application.properties.
Run the application using your preferred IDE or command line.
Use the provided endpoints for user registration and login to receive JWT tokens.
Secure your API endpoints by validating the JWT tokens.

Usage:

This project serves as a foundational template for any application requiring secure user authentication and API protection. 
It can be extended and customized to fit specific business requirements.
